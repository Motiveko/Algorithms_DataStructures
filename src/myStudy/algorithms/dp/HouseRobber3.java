	The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. 
	There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." 
	Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. 
	After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". 
	It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
	Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.
	Example 1:
	     3
	    / \
	   2   3
	    \   \ 
	     3   1
	Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
	Example 2:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 1   3   1
	Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
